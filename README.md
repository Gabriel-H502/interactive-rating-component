### What I learned

This was my oportunity to pratice my JS for the first time. I'm feeling proud of not actually googled a solution to it. Just for a documentation of something specific, like 'classList' property. For the most part, just relyed on 'Ctrl' + 'Space' to search what I needed and looked for some projects I had from some events I joined.

### Continued development

I want to get better on JS for now. This was a startup and I'm feeling confident and looking forward to upgrade these skills :D
